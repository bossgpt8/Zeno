#1: Qwen2.5-VL-7B
Type: Vision-Language (text + images)
Why it wins:

✅ Best-in-class 7B VL model — understands screenshots, UIs, diagrams.
✅ Handles “Edit this image”, “Fix the typo in this mockup”, “Describe this chart” natively.
✅ Runs fast on consumer hardware (even CPU with GGUF quantization).
✅ Free via Hugging Face, OpenRouter, or self-hosted.
✅ Strong in both English & Chinese (great for global users).
Best for: Default mode — your Image Edit, Learn, and Problem Solver cards.

🥈 #2: FLUX.1 Schnell
Type: Image Generation (text-to-image)
Why it’s #2:

✅ Fastest high-quality image model — outperforms SDXL & DALL·E 3 in speed/quality trade-off.
✅ MIT-licensed → safe for commercial use (unlike some SDXL variants).
✅ Great prompt adherence — ideal for UI mockups, logos, social assets.
✅ Integrates cleanly with your Image generation card.
Best for: Your Image generation card — set as default “Premium” option.

🥉 #3: Mistral Small 3.1
Type: Text-only (but ultra-efficient)
Why it’s top 3:

✅ 128K context — handles full documents, codebases, research papers.
✅ Near-Llama-3.3-70B quality at ~1/5 the cost (~$0.15/million tokens).
✅ Blazing fast inference (ideal for chat UX).
✅ Strong instruction-following — perfect for Explain, Brainstorm, and Code help.
Best for: Default text backbone when no image is involved.

🏅 #4: Qwen3 Coder
Type: Code-specialized LLM
Why it stands out:

✅ Trained specifically on modern code (TS, Python, Rust, etc.).
✅ Beats general models (even Llama-3.3-70B) on HumanEval & real-world debugging.
✅ Understands project context — great for Web Dev and Code help cards.
✅ Open weights (Apache 2.0) — safe to self-host.
Best for: Your Web Dev and Code help workflows — swap in automatically when user asks for coding.

🏅 #5: Nemotron Nano 12B-VL
Type: Multimodal (vision + video + documents)
Why it’s rising fast:

✅ NVIDIA-backed — excellent engineering & tooling (TensorRT-LLM support).
✅ First open VL model to handle video frames & PDF diagrams natively.
✅ 12B size → better reasoning than Qwen-VL-7B, still efficient.
✅ Future-proofs BossAI for video tutorials, screen recordings, and slide decks.
Best for: Pro tier — when users upload videos, presentations, or complex docs.
